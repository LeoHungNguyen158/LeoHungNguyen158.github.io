# 📌 Executive Summary

This project evaluates the launch strategy of a Houston-based microbrewery through a robust combination of **quantitative modeling**, **risk simulation**, and **operational optimization**.  
Using data-driven decision frameworks, we assessed demand variability, defect rates, seasonal production cycles, and financial outcomes.

Key analytical components include:

- **Monte Carlo Simulation (1,000+ iterations)** to evaluate risk and uncertainty in brewing output  
- **Decision Tree Analysis** to analyze strategic production alternatives  
- **Linear Programming Optimization** for production scheduling and ingredient allocation  
- **Break-even and Profitability Modeling** for investment feasibility  
- **Hypergeometric Distribution** for defect rate evaluation in microchip quality testing  

This integrated approach resulted in a projected **15% ROI by Year 3**, with enhanced visibility into risks, operational constraints, and market positioning.
