# 📌 Executive Summary

This project analyzes Airbnb listing data from Copenhagen using a blend of **predictive modeling, clustering, and classification methods**.  
The primary goals were to:

- Identify **key price drivers**  
- Build a **predictive regression model**  
- Segment listings using **PCA + K-Means**  
- Classify property types using **Naïve Bayes, KNN, and Decision Trees**  
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** for hosts and investors  

The final regression model achieved an **Adjusted R² of 0.572**, indicating strong explanatory power relative to typical real-estate datasets.

# 🔍 Key Insights

### 🏷️ 1. Price Drivers Identified  
The strongest predictors of price included:  
- Room type  
- Number of guests  
- Location coordinates  
- Host rating  
- Cleaning fee  
- Property size  

### 🧩 2. Clustered Listing Profiles  
Using PCA + K-Means, three main clusters emerged:  
- **Budget Listings** – small units, lower review scores  
- **Standard Listings** – mid-tier price & amenities  
- **Premium Listings** – large accommodations, strong ratings  

### 🎯 3. Classification Accuracy  
Among classification methods tested, **Decision Tree** achieved the best balance of accuracy and interpretability.

### 💡 4. Business Recommendations  
- Hosts can optimize revenue by adjusting price in line with identified predictors  
- Investors can target neighborhoods with highest value-to-cost ratio  
- Airbnb could implement cluster-based recommendation engines
